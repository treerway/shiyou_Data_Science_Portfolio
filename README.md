# [Project 2: Dallas Child Poverty Analysis With Regression Approach](https://github.com/treerway/DallasPoverty/blob/master/%5BCPAL%5D%20Group%204%269%20Final%20Python%20Code.ipynb)
* This project aims at identifying indicators that would represent the level to which family plays a role in child poverty in a given census tract. We aim at creating a score for all census tracts in Dallas. This score would tell us how well the census tract is doing in terms of family.
* Generally, we expand our indicator from only one to five comprehensive indicators
* The methodology of combining indicators we use is perason correlation and features importance of random forest

# [Project 3: Customer behaivor prediction for Bank Campaign](https://github.com/treerway/Bank_Campagin/blob/main/projec1_classification.ipynb)
* In this project, we are interested in predicting whethor one singe client will subscribe a long-term deposit product 
* in bank campaign conducted by marketing phone
* we complete the EDA, data preprocessing, and use gridsearch to tuning the model to get the performence 
* we use roc-auc score as the metrics to evaluate different model
